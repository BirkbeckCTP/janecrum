        <h2>Our Story_</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Director of Michigan Publishing Services Jason Colman met Director and lead developer of Janeway Andy Byers during a pre-conference presentation at the of 2018 Library Publishing Forum in Minneapolis. On that overcast and coffee-fuelled May morning, they found themselves in the company of a handful of likeminded academics and developers who had built new platforms without yet knowing of each other’s work and how together it might represent a wider movement towards university-owned publishing infrastructures.</p>
                <p>Michigan had been concentrating their resources into building book publishing workflows which they’d imagined one day adapting to journals. However, watching Andy’s slides, Jason realised that the Janeway team had already coded the journal software that the Michigan folks were visualising one day needing to create from scratch.<p>
                <p>Recognising that there was no need to build it twice, Michigan migrated their journals to Janeway and doubled-down their focus on accessibility and multi-media for books. The pair have since developed a strong cross-Atlantic partnership, with Michigan lending expertise about hosting media rich content without using commercial infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Experiencing what sharing ideas and resources can make possible, they extended this ethos of collaboration. More recently, they have put forward successful joint bids to provide services for other missioned-aligned publishers in the open movement community.</p>
